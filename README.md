Streaming
=======

In a nutshell, Streaming is a real-time engine with Complex Event Processing capabilities with a built-in and powerful Streaming Query Language for doing on-demand operations on your streams.

Streaming provides a simple Java/Scala API to send commands to the engine and retrieve information from existing streams.

The key components of Streaming Engine provide a fault-tolerant, high availability and extremely performant solution in order to work with thousands of miles of events per minute.
