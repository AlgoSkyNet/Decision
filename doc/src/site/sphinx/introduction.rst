Nowadays data-intensive processes and organizations of all sorts require the use of real-time data
with increasing flexibility and complexity, so we created Stratio Decision to meet this demand.
Stratio Decision is one of the core modules on which the Stratio platform is based.
Stratio Decision is the union of a real-time messaging bus with a complex event processing engine
using Spark Streaming. Thanks to this technology, Stratio Decision allows the creation of streams
and queries on the fly, sending massive data streams, building complex windows over the data or
manipulating the streams in a simple way by using an SQL-like language.
Stratio Decision’s API masks the complexity of the system so that developers can work with live
streams straightaway. The engine Stratio Decision also offers built-in solution patterns which
solve typical use cases and common problems related to streaming. Additionally, we have added global
features to the engine such as auditing and statistics.


Many big data applications must process batch scenarios combined with
large streams of live data and provide results in near-real-time, but
the lack of an hybrid framework (batch/real) forces the companies to
double the effort to implement new functions.


Existing traditional streaming systems have a
event-driven-record-at-a-time processing model, keeping states by
record. Making stateful streams processing be fault-tolerant is
challenging.


With the advent of Apache Spark, all these issues and challenges have
been resolved and now there is a new and powerful way to design
distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant systems. For that reason,
Stratio Decision Engine is based on Apache Spark Streaming.


But real-time and big data require a high level of flexibility,
performance, powerful features and on-demand queries, so we have
included Complex Event Processing capabilities and real-time operations.


This way, you can use Stratio Decision to define or alter your streams
on the fly, launch a complex query with sliding temporal windows, or
save your streams to Apache Cassandra… and these are only a few examples
of the features available.
